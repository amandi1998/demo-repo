A book is a medium for recording information in the form of writing or images, typically composed of many pages 
(made of papyrus, parchment, vellum, or paper) bound together and protected by a cover.[1] The technical term for this physical arrangement
is codex (plural, codices).

In the history of hand-held physical supports for extended written compositions or records, the codex replaces its predecessor, the scroll.
A single sheet in a codex is a leaf and each side of a leaf is a page.
 
As an intellectual object, a book is prototypically a composition of such great length that it takes a considerable 
investment of time to compose and still considered as an investment of time to read.
